TODO :
	- FUTURE TASK: View attendance for member
	- FUTURE TASK: Event activity screen
	- FUTURE TASK: Sometimes when switching views the loading message doesn't stop
	- BUG: Inbox/Polls/Sent: Default text for when there are no messages.
	- TASK: Implement video manually or leave it out?
	
	x Can't send a message. Send button never goes active -- similar to the create team button never going active.
	x I have an indicator saying I have 3 messages unread on the main screen.  I go into messages and I see 3 messages rows highlighted differently -- so far so good.  I go ahead and view those messages.  Even if I leave messages and come back in, the highlighting hasn't changed and the main screen still says I have 3 messages.
	x I can't create a team.  I enter all the fields, but the create button is still inactive. Can you create a team?
	x switch out google analytics keys
	x look @ iphone analytics
	x when scoring, if I advance the interval/inning, then the "-" button gets mostly hidden under the "+" button
	x menu icons for reading a message
