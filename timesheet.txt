TODO :
	- FUTURE TASK: View attendance for member
	- FUTURE TASK: Event activity screen
	- FUTURE TASK: Sometimes when switching views the loading message doesn't stop
	x TASK: Twitter sign up during create team.
	x TASK: What to do when you're a fan of the team -- team home probably should look slightly different.
	x TASK: Utilize the Quick Links space better when there are none ?
	x TASK: Make all log events use the same identifier or at least similar ones:
		rTeam, rTeam.API, rTeam.etc...
	x BUG: Show twitter icon when they use twitter on activity
	x TASK: Settings page -> auto login, alerts ?
	x TASK: Give feedback, Rate rTeam
	x BUG: Error on first load
	x TASK: Implement photos and videos for activity page.
	- BUG: Figure out if there's a bug or something with event creation from the home page 
		-- the times seem to get messed up when the events are loaded up from the server
		-- and they don't get added to the quick links, which they should.
	- TASK: Implement video manually or leave it out?
